# GEOP591 - Theoretical-Seismology

GEOP 591 is a graduate special course (called theoretical seismology) offered at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM). The custodian of this repository took the course in Term 242 (January 12, 2025 - May 28, 2025). The course instructor during this period was Dr. Wei Zhou. So, this repository will contain detailed mathematical derivation to some classical solutions in theoretical seismology. 

Although some of the solutions in this repository can be found in classic theoretical seismology textbooks, such as Quantitative Seismology by Aki and Richards, I have a few issues with these texts. One major concern is that they often do not include detailed mathematical derivations for problemsâ€”something I greatly value. As such, these textbooks can be particularly challenging for beginners in theoretical seismology, as they tend to omit intermediate steps in the derivations. I had the same concern when I first started the course, as the lack of detailed explanations made it difficult to follow the material.

The tutorials in this repository aim to bridge that gap. As such, a junior or senior undergraduate student with a solid understanding of key concepts in integral and differential calculus should be able to follow the material in this repository without any problem. This material can also use by graduate student or faculties to introduce student to theoretical seismology.
